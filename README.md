## OOP Patterns in Java

This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns in Java. It covers examples and explanations of the most commonly used design patterns, categorized into three main types: Behavioral, Creational, and Structural.
Patterns Included

1. Behavioral Patterns

   - Chain of Responsibility: Pass requests along a chain of handlers until one of them processes the request.
   - Iterator: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - Observer: Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
   - Strategy: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
   -  Visitor: Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure without changing their classes.

2. Creational Patterns

   - Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
   - Builder: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
   - Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and create new objects by copying this prototype.
   - Singleton: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

3. Structural Patterns

   - Adapter: Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
   - Composite: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
   - Decorator: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   - Facade: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
   - Proxy: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
